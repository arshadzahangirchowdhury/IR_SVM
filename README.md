This program trains a support vector classifier to recognize experimental IR spectra.

Training data and a validation spectrum is provided for the user.

Instructions 

This notebook reads the input data from user's google drive.


Download the folder "IR_DATA_1wvnstep_10um_decades_Ex" from Github and copy it to user's google drive. These are the training and testing spectra.


Download the "H2O-4-NIST.xlsx" experimental spectrum from Github and copy it to user's google drive.


When the program is run for the first time, user must authenticate to allow it to use the user's google drive.


Once authenticated the program will run and should identify the spectrum belonging to the H2O class.


Alternatively, user can download this code and the data and run it locally by changing the path variables pathMaster and path_exp
